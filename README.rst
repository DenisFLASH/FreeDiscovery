Open Source Software for E-Discovery and Information Retrieval


FreeDiscovery is build on top of existing machine learning libraries (e.g.  scikit-learn) and provides REST web services for information retrieval applications. In particular, it aims to benefit existing e-discovery platforms. At present, a variety of binary categorization, clustering and duplicate detection algorithms are supported. Work is underway on e-mail threading.

In addition, FreeDiscovery can be used as Python package and aims to expose methods with a scikit-learn compatible API. 

The final release is expected for January 1, 2017, but we would very much appreciate feedback on existing categorization and clustering. Feel free to submit encountered issues to the issue tracker and send any comments to grossman@ir.cs.georgetown.edu.  

For more information see the `documentation and API Reference <https://freediscovery.github.io/doc/dev/>`_.

FreeDiscovery is released under the 3-clause BSD licence.
