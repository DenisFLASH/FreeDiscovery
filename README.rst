Open Source Software for E-Discovery and Information Retrieval


FreeDiscovery provides a REST web services tier on top of existing, open source machine learning libraries (e.g.; scikit-learn, etc.) and aims to benefit existing e-discovery platforms.  Other applications outside of e-discovery may benefit as well.  At present, a variety of binary categorization and clustering algorithms are supported. Work is underway on duplicate detection and e-mail threading.

FreeDiscovery should be done January 1, 2017, but we would very much appreciate feedback on existing categorization and clustering.  Feel free to submit encountered issues to the issue tracker and send any comments to grossman@ir.cs.georgetown.edu.
